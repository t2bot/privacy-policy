# t2bot.io Terms of Use and Privacy Policy

t2bot.io is a public bridge, bot, and integration network for [matrix](https://matrix.org). 
When this document refers to *t2bot.io* or *we*, it means the owners and operators of the
services, which are identified by the [+admins:t2bot.io](https://riot.im/app/#/group/+admins:t2bot.io)
group on matrix. 

This document is based primarily upon the [myBalsamiq Terms of Use](https://docs.balsamiq.com/mybalsamiq/tos/).

## Changes to this document

Whenever we change this document, an announcement will be made in the following places:
* In the dedicated support room, [#help:t2bot.io](https://matrix.to/#/#help:t2bot.io)
* In the dedicated changelog room, [#privacypolicy:t2bot.io](https://matrix.to/#/#privacypolicy:t2bot.io)
* In any rooms where the bot [@privacypolicy:t2bot.io](https://matrix.to/#/@privacypolicy:t2bot.io) is a member

If you're not comfortable with any of those options, keep a watch on the repository for this
document ([github.com/t2bot/privacy-policy](https://github.com/t2bot/privacy-policy)). The

## Using t2bot.io means accepting these terms

By making use of the services we offer, you agree to these terms. The current version of these
terms are the terms that are applied. We'll always provide advanced notice of changes before
new terms come into effect. 

"Making use of the services we offer" means:
* Using or browsing the t2bot.io website
* Interacting with the integrations we offer. This can mean many things, so here's some examples:
  * Using a widget which is served from t2bot.io - the people who load this widget are subject 
    to these terms of service.
  * Sending events in a room with a bot from t2bot.io. This sounds scary at first, however we're
    not trying to steal your data or provide an avenue for spying. We need to say that talking
    in a room means accepting our terms of service to avoid abuse and so that the bot can do 
    something when it is supposed to. What each bot does is explained later on in this document.
  * Triggering a bridge from a third party source (such as Telegram, Twitter, or Discord). Again,
    this sounds scary but it is to ensure that we can avoid abuse and still offer the service.

## Withdrawing or declining these terms

If you do not agree to all of the terms and conditions in this document, do not use t2bot.io. 

To help make this possible, we're happy to make sure that bridges and bots ignore your messages.
This will still mean that our servers may receive and store data, such as messages, that relate
to you. We cannot avoid this because the nature of matrix (and how bridges work) means the data
is pushed to us. The bots and bridges you have selected to be ignored by will only check that
they are supposed to discard the data, at which point they will cease processing. 

To have a bot or bridge ignore you, please get in contact with us either through our support 
room ([#help:t2bot.io](https://matrix.to/#/#help:t2bot.io)) or by sending a private message to
someone in the [+admins:t2bot.io](https://riot.im/app/#/group/+admins:t2bot.io) group. Requests
are processed within 24 hours. Likewise, to have a bot or bridge stop ignoring you, please 
reach out to us.

Please do not abuse our capability to have a bot or bridge ignore you. Frequent requests to be
ignored (or not ignored) may result in bots and bridges ignoring you temporarily or permanently
at our discretion. 

## Breach of terms

If you breach any of the terms and conditions of this document, your access and use of our services
automatically terminates. Requests to delete personal data after termination will still be processed,
and will happen automatically if termination is detected.

We may block, restrict, disable, suspend, or terminate your access to all or part of the services
we offer at any time in our sole discretion, without prior notice or liability to you. We haven't
had to do this yet, and we really don't want to.

If you think your access has wrongly been affected, please reach out to us.

## Support and Service Level Agreement (SLA)

Support is available from both us and the community in [#help:t2bot.io](https://matrix.to/#/#help:t2bot.io).
We take pride in ensuring that everyone gets their concerns addressed, but we are also a very small
team of volunteers. This means we will do our best to answer any comments or questions, but please 
have patience if it takes us a little while to answer.

Most of our services are also documented on [our website](https://t2bot.io). This is a great resource
for finding out how to do common things, like setting up bots and bridges in your rooms.

We do not provide an SLA or guarantee of uptime. We will do our best to ensure that all the services
are online and functioning, however there may be times where something is down for an extended period
of time. For information on our current system status, please visit [status.t2bot.io](https://status.t2bot.io).

## Your data

Your data is important, and we don't want it. We do offer public services though, and that means we'll
be in contact with your information. The information we do collect is not shared with third parties
except when troubleshooting Synapse (our homeserver software). The Synapse developers may require unaltered
logs from our system to troubleshoot a problem we are having. We will not provide unaltered logs until
requested - we'll always start with logs that have personal information redacted.

Each service we offer collects different personal data. We have outlined each service below.

### t2bot.io (our website)

Personal data that is collected:
* Your web browser's User Agent - this is used to troubleshoot issues with particular web browsers on our
  website.
* Your IP Address - this is used for debugging and analytics only.

TODO: Describe how long logs are kept

## TODO: Other services (synapse, media repo, bots, etc)
